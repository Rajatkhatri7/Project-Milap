# What is a Data Structure? 


Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it 
enables easier access and efficient modifications. 
Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. 


# Types of Data Structures in Python


Python has implicit support for Data Structures which 
enable you to store and access data. 
These structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.

Python allows its users to create their own Data Structures 
enabling them to have full control over their functionality. 
The most prominent Data Structures are Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List and so on which are also available to you in other programming languages. 
So now that you know what are the types available to you, why don’t we move ahead to the Data Structures and implement them using Python.

#Built-in Data Structures

As the name suggests, these Data Structures are built-in with Python 
which makes programming easier and helps programmers use them to obtain solutions faster. 
Let’s discuss each of them in detail.


# NOtation

BIG(O) ;-O(n) n is length of string

# approximation

O(2n+3) = O(n)
 
 nesting loop = multiply
 different loop = sum
