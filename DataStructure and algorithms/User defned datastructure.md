# Arrays vs. Lists

Arrays and lists are the same structure with one difference. Lists allow heterogeneous data element storage whereas Arrays allow only homogenous elements to be stored within them.


# Stack

Stacks are linear Data Structures which are based on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) where data which is entered last will be the first to get accessed. It is built using the array structure and has operations namely, pushing (adding) elements, popping (deleting) elements and accessing elements only from one point in the stack called as the TOP. This TOP is the pointer to the current position of the stack. Stacks are prominently used in applications such as Recursive Programming, reversing words, undo mechanisms in word editors and so forth.




# Queue

A queue is also a linear data structure which is based on the principle of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) where the data entered first will be accessed first. It is built using the array structure and has operations which can be performed from both ends of the Queue, that is, head-tail or front-back. Operations such as adding and deleting elements are called En-Queue and De-Queue and accessing the elements can be performed. Queues are used as Network Buffers for traffic congestion management, used in Operating Systems for Job Scheduling and many more.



# Tree

Trees are non-linear Data Structures which have root and nodes. The root is the node from where the data originates and the nodes are the other data points that are available to us. The node that precedes is the parent and the node after is called the child. There are levels a tree has to show the depth of information. The last nodes are called the leaves. Trees create a hierarchy which can be used in a lot of real-world applications such as the HTML pages use trees to distinguish which tag comes under which block. It is also efficient in searching purposes and much more.



# Linked List

Linked lists are linear Data Structures which are not stored consequently but are linked with each other using pointers. The node of a linked list is composed of data and a pointer called next. These structures are most widely used in image viewing applications, music player applications and so forth.



# Graph

Graphs are used to store data collection of points called vertices (nodes) and edges (edges). Graphs can be called as the most accurate representation of a real-world map. They are used to find the various cost-to-distance between the various data points called as the nodes and hence find the least path. Many applications such as Google Maps, Uber, and many more use Graphs to find the least distance and increase profits in the best ways.



# HashMaps

HashMaps are the same as what dictionaries are in Python. They can be used to implement applications such as phonebooks, populate data according to the lists and much more.


That wraps up all the prominent Data Structures in Python. I hope you have understood built-in as well as the user-defined Data Structures that we have in Python and why they are important.
